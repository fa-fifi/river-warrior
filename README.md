## Inspiration
**River Warrior** draws its spirit from the incredible efforts of [Sungai Watch](https://sungai.watch/pages/about-us), a team of dedicated people known as 'river warriors', who are very committed to stemming the tide of plastic pollution. Every day, they brave the elements, working tirelessly to find innovative solutions to prevent plastic waste from reaching our oceans. Their passion and dedication in saving our planet truly deserve a global recognition.

Through this game, we invite you to step into the shoes of these real-life heroes, wielding your virtual blade to slash through the waves of plastic pollution threatening our waterways. With each swipe, you're not just scoring points – you're making a statement. You're standing up for our environment, advocating for cleaner rivers, and inspiring change. Together, we can turn the tide against plastic pollution and protect our precious waterways for generations to come.

## Gameplay

> **Cut the plastics before they reach the body of water**

Each plastic will score you 1 point. Try your best to cut every single piece of plastic because players can only afford to miss them 3 times. We specifically chose single-used plastics (SUPs) to instill awareness about their environmental impact and foster a sense of responsibility among players.

> **Collect coins to boost your score**

There are 3 different types of coins: copper, silver and gold. Each coin has a different number of points, but don't worry if you miss them; it won't cost you a life. Collect them as much as you can to help you reach a higher score and obtain rarer powerups.

> **Avoid rocks as they can break your blade**

They come in a variety of sizes and colors. Always be careful, as slashing rocks will end the game immediately unless you have unlocked the **Master Shredder** powerup. Cutting them will cost you 10 points, and if your score becomes negative, you will lose the game.

## Powerups
Collect all 6 powerups and add them into your Google Wallet. However, this is only available on Android. If you are playing this game on different platforms, you can copy the code and save it somewhere else. Don't forget to share them with your friends too!

## Challenges
▪ **I know nothing about game development**

Playing video games was my passion and my hobby, but I was never interested in building one. Honestly, I thought of giving up on this hackathon almost every day. I spent the first two weeks entirely devoting myself to learning the Flame game engine. It is a tiring journey since I also have a full-time job and a family to take care of. I only spend 3 hours per day at night to focus on this project.

▪ **I don't know how to create game assets**

There are a lot of free game assets on the internet, but none of them match what I want. So, I ended up creating them using Canva, lol. Thanks to the latest AI technology, I was able to generate several assets that I needed just based on my prompts. Almost every image you saw in this game was made using AI, so no one can sue me for copyright infringement.

▪ **I never joined a hackathon before**

As a self-taught developer, I always feel intimidated by other developers who have more experience than me. The only reason I joined this hackathon is because Flutter is the first framework I learned as a programmer, so I have a bit of confidence to compete with others. Winning this contest would be a life-changing experience and a big step forward in my career.

## What's Next?

In case this project is listed among the top 10 finalists, I would like to reach out to **Sungai Watch** team for a collaboration since they are my inspiration for this game. Maybe I could monetize this game and donate all its earnings to fund their good deeds and spread more awareness regarding this environmental issue in our community and society.

Even though they are based in Indonesia, which is not my home country but I hope one day they are financially stable enough to open a branch in Malaysia. Plastic pollution is also a big issue here, and as citizens, we have to figure out how to resolve this issue before it is too late. Like the former president of Ford, **Lee Iacocca** once said, *"Even a correct decision is wrong when it was taken too late."*
